# REST API with Spring Boot

It's a simple design of a REST API to start learning how manage and work with the MVC pattern in Spring, 
it can be take as a basis to keep learning or develop a complex project from something simple. 

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies
- [Spring](https://spring.io/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)

## ‚ú® Features
- Dependencies used Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL Driver. Recommend use [Spring initializr](https://start.spring.io/) it's really useful to build an app and you can change maven or the DB driver if you rather try something else.
- Docker used the images [postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) and [dpage/pgadmin4](https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/latest/container_deployment.html) it can be changed if you rather other DB but in that case you must change the DB driver too and the JPA if you use a NoSQL DB.
- Postman it's not necesary, I like it to prove APIs but it can be change for any other software or method.

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone repository

```console
git clone https://github.com/Hecgarx2/spring-rest-api.git
cd spring-rest-api
```

2. Run container
As it was mentioned before this container get DB Postgres and pgAdmin to manage the data. 
```console
docker-compose up -d
docker container ls
```
With that the containers are running, you can go to [http://localhost:8081/](http://localhost:8081/) and use pgAdmin with data in `docker-compose.yml`, you can change the credentials or database name if you want.

3. Run Backend
```console
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```
With that you installed all the dependencies in the project and you can start testing the API with Postman or go to [http://localhost:8080/todos](http://localhost:8080/todos) and check the GET method.
